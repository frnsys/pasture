## Pasture

When teaching Python to students, I've found the hardest part is all the setup involved. Some students have different computers, depending on the class, many might have never programmed before and don't have any dev environment at all. Walking everyone through preparing their systems takes _forever_.

__Pasture__ simplifies this - all you need to do is install it on one machine and then setup that machine's dev environment. It runs a web server which allows students to write Python scripts and have them evaluated by the remote environment - stdout and errors are communicated back to them.
